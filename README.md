# SimplePythonCalculator
A simple, lightweight, Python calculator that runs in the Command-Line

If there are any ways I can improve it (besides giving it a gui) let me know in the Issues tab

Note: Project has mainly been replaced by [SimpleRustCalculator](https://github.com/redkittty/SimpleRustCalculator)
